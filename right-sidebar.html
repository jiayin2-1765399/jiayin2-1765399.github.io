								<h2>How to Choose Your Travel Destination</h2>
								<span class="byline">By Jackie Sills-Dellegrazie</span>
							</header>
							<p>Do you want to travel but don’t know where you should go? Are you looking for a little clarity and inspiration to get your trip planning started? You’re in the right place! This post has the questions you should ask yourself and 5 tips on where you can go to find and choose your travel destination.</p>
							<p>You want your trip to be a success and that starts with a right-fit destination. But, choosing your travel destination feels overwhelming. No worries. This can happen whether you’re planning your first trip or you’re a seasoned traveler. Break the process down into smaller pieces to sort out the practicalities and uncover your motivation to travel.</p>
							<p>Are you thinking about a long weekend getaway, a 2-week trip, extended travel, or something in between? Depending on where you live and the amount of time you have to travel, certain destinations will make more sense than others. Regardless of whether you want to relax or have an active adventure, traveling too far or cramming in too much can make for a rushed, ungratifying trip.</p>
							<p>Are you traveling as a couple, with children, for a girl’s/guy’s trip, or solo? The people you travel with or the lack thereof might make specific places and experiences more practical than others. What kind of destination would be enjoyable for everyone traveling? If you’re traveling solo, is it your first time or have you been on your own before? Are you looking for an experience out of your comfort zone? Or would you prefer to keep things easy for yourself by taking a tour?</p>
							<p>Do you want to sightsee when it’s warm or work on your tan? Do you prefer cooler temperatures or want to see that perfect winter white landscape? Obviously, your weather preference can help narrow down possible travel destinations based on when you intend to travel. Keep in mind that traveling during peak seasons comes with higher prices. Would you be ok traveling during a shoulder season in order to save money? Oftentimes, the weather is pleasant, but may not be for what you were ideally looking. On the upside, fewer people visit during these times, which means you’ll be less affected by crowds.</p>
