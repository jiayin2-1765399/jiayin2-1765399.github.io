								<h2>The Importance of Traveling</h2>
								<span class="byline">by LIVVY CLARK </span>
							</header>
							<p>You hear many talk about trips they’re planning on taking. Whether it be a great distance or just an hour away, travel is so important for your own character development. Not to mention that you get to experience new things with every place you have never been before. Traveling is the best way to get out of your comfort zone and invites you to experience life in different ways.
								Traveling is something really unique, and there are only so many things we can learn in a school environment. Travel really can’t be taught; you can learn about other cultures, but you can’t be fully taught unless you experience it. Scientifically, it is shown that traveling also gains you more confidence and a great way to develop cultural sensitivity. Not to mention if you travel abroad, you can most likely be submerged into a second or third language.
								To me, traveling is something that absolutely blows my mind. Seeing something that you have never seen before, being places that people live everyday and forget the beauty of their home and become absolutely in awe of the surroundings, and knowing that sometimes places are so different from where you’re familiar.</p>
							<p>I actually had the pleasure of visiting Syros, Greece for about a month, and let me tell you; that was the moment I knew I wanted to see the world. It was such an experience being with friends and seeing all these new things that I knew I may never get to see again. It’s so important to take in every moment in when you’re traveling. Even if it is a location easily accessible to you, because in the moment, you may never see that same thing again.
								I cannot stress enough, if you have the financial ability to travel… pack up today. There is no way that if I had a large amount of money, that I would stay in one place for more than a day. There may be a lot of crazy things going on in the world at all times, but there’s one thing that redeems all the bad; beauty.</p>
							<p>The best thing I can advise is travel to things you have yet to experience. If you’ve been somewhere before by yourself, take a friend, and have them take in what you have seen. It’s so important to travel by yourself and with others, each time it will be a different experience. That’s the beauty of travel, is that you can always have a new time when you go to the same place. You can take advantage of the food they offer at the places you travel. If you go to the same location all the time, you can always find new spots to have a bite and you will get a whole knew idea of that area.
								The second thing I can advise for traveling to a new destination, is to find places that aren’t tourist attractions. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve found places that no one even know exist and them ending up being my favorite spots. Look for little cafes, diners, locally owned shops, tiny stores that are hidden next to famous spots. While I believe you should see and experience the big things, it’s the little things that matter to me the most. I’d rather sit in a local restaurant with a friendly staff and home feeling, as apposed to a busy chain joint where you can barely move or think in how busy it is.</p>
